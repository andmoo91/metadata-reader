# metadata-reader
This is a collection of simple imagej macros to read the metadata off of processed Airyscan 1, Airyscan 2, or Lattice SIM .czi files from the JLS LSM 880, LSM980, or Elyra 7 Lattice SIM.
I will eventually write one script that will call one of the three functions, but right now you have to match the script to the datatype. This may or may not work on other 880/980 systems but I suspect there will be errors.
Feel free to email me or message me on twitter if you want any assistance tailoring it to your scope's metadata.
This is obviously a work in progress and relies heavly on the bioformats macro extensions.  ChatGPT4 helped annotate and clean up the code. I claim no expertise of any kind in any domain of knowledge,this macro may not work for you... caveat emptor.
